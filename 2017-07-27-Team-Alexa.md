Hi! We are a team of computational linguists/Python/Django developers from Moscow, Russia. We are working on a JClub project. It’s a social network for LGBTQI+ people. It’s built using Django framework, and our goal is to make it multilingual.

## What a wonderful world
Our third month with the RGSoC is already coming to an end. We are happy to be a part of such an incredible program that attracts people to open source.


## What tasks we had?

## What we learned
* Django
* VCS: Mercurial, some Git
* About databases
* Time management
* To compromise

## Challenges we faced
The most difficult part for us was planning our tasks, and then sticking to our plans. It seemed like the obvious thing to take care of, but most of the tasks took more time than we planned for them. We tried to listen to our coach Katya’s advise and to plan 3x more time than seemed right to us for each task, and sometimes it even worked, but sometimes even that amount of time wasn’t enough. But we think we’ve got better with planning by the end of the summer, so we would probably call it a progress.
