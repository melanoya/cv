Hi! We are a team of computational linguists/Python/Django developers from Moscow, Russia. We are working on a JClub project. It’s a social network for LGBTQI+ people. It’s built using Django framework, and our goal is to make it multilingual.

* Four and a half years ago Sasha was going to be an interpreter and believed that she had no talent for math and programming.
* She studied Russian sign language for two years, and knows it better than any other foreign language.
* She can juggle and do slacklining.
* From the first year at the university Sasha’s been studying Yiddish. She even went once to Moldova to find there native Yiddish speakers.
* Adores phonetics and automatic speech recognition!

* Gives public lectures on computational linguistics, chatbots, machine learning, and all that AI stuff. Once managed to explain a group of 11-years-old how neural networks work, was (and still is) very proud of herself.
* At 16 she made a promise to herself that she will never ever ever get into programming. Broke it at 19, first week at the university.
* Listens to a lot of music. Like, A LOT. Used to spend most of her money on concert tickets, been to a 30+ shows.
* Can’t do anything without tea, drinks up to 10 cups of tea per day.
* Studied Indonesian for a year, just for fun.



We met each other four years ago at the university. Despite the fact that we’ve been classmates, we met only at the end of the first year in preparation for the exam in language theory. Then we went roller-skating, and from there our friendship began. Many walks, board games, delicious food and joint projects awaited us in the future.
During these years, we worked together on many projects in various fields, from sociolinguistics to web development, and we’ve always been a great team, because we make each other stronger.


#### Mentor and  Coaches:

[__Josh Matthews__:](https://twitter.com/lastontheboat)
An amazing person we ever got to interact with. Sometimes we both discuss about how is it possible for a person to be filled with such talent :P. He is always up for the help. He is an amazing developer and a mentor. Everyone we interact with said us one thing, “You Girls are on safe hands”.

[__Ravi Sankar__:](https://wafflespeanut.github.io)
Ravi is Code fiddler, FOSS enthusiast, science lover, Pythonista, Rustacean, Mozillian, juggler, adventurer and rest we are still figuring out. Find more about him here: https://wafflespeanut.github.io

[__Rahul Sharma__:](http://creativcoder.github.io/)
Rahul is passionately curious about computer science and programming. He is 2016 GSoC Intern with Servo and currently works at AtherEnergy. He also contributes to rustc, and other projects in the Rust Community. His interests includes systems programming, realtime web technologies, compilers and type theory. 

## About Our Work 

Just like our mentor Josh Matthews (jdm on IRC) says on FosDem, "Basically all of the browser engines you are using were designed before the year 2000, and hardware at that time was very different. It usually only had one core, clock speeds were lower and you had much less memory available to you"
In Servo, things run in parallel. Also according to Josh “Modern engines will often be able to do the actual painting to the screen in parallel and then you have a loop between computing and executing. Even so there are a lot of serial and sequential operations that we believe we could do better”
We are working on making servo support responsive images.
